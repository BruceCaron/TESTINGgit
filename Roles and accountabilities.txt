Process: based on new kind of governance structure called holacracy. A really well-articulated flat structure, distributed authority scheme. Create an organization where the responsibilities for various things are granted to different people in the organization; they're "energizing" particular roles.
Two kinds of meetings:

1) Governance meeting (today's example), roles are determined and accountabilities are detailed, ex. "Election role," all the work belongs to the roles, and every person is destined to have multiple roles. Can volunteer, and/or they may be assigned by the lead link if certain roles are not being filled (don't determine the role).

2) Tactical meetings; talking about tensions that come up, as far as activities or a need to move or adjust a role.
Project; something that has a beginning and an end.

Point is; there are no job descriptions, we're promising that we're going to energize whatever roles we're fulfilling. Also tracking how the role is going and how well it fits in with the other roles and interactions. Individuals are responsible for the timing and definition of the role, and for getting things moving along.

In the EarthCube setting things are currently emerging, so we want the ability to add roles when there are new working groups or particular requests from the CTs. Something new comes up on the edge of a role, gets done initially, but if it'll be a recurring role needs to be added in.
